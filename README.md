# AISSAI - Pytorch Optimization

Pytorch is a popular library to build and work with machine learning models. Different techniques are available to optimize both training and inference in PyTorch, enabling faster, more efficient model execution. We will walk through some of these to show how it is possible to accelerate inference and training. We will have an overview on various methods like mixed precision, memory optimization strategies, and distributed training, all aimed at achieving optimal performance for large-scale machine learning models.

## The notebook

You will need a python environment where you will need to install few packages:

```shell
pip install transformers torch jupyter matplotlib
```

Then open the notebook:

```shell
jupyter notebook
```
